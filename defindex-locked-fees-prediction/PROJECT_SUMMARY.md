# Project Summary

## Purpose

This project demonstrates calling `report()` and `lock_fees()` atomically on a DeFindex Vault using the Stellar Router SDK.

## Why This Matters

### The Problem
**Fees can ONLY be locked AFTER a report is updated.**

In the DeFindex vault smart contract:
1. `report()` updates the current strategy performance data
2. `lock_fees()` uses this updated data to calculate and lock fees
3. Calling them separately risks inconsistent state

### The Solution: Stellar Router SDK

The router enables **atomic execution**:
- Both functions execute in a **single transaction**
- If one fails, **both are rolled back**
- Guaranteed **consistent state**
- **Reduced fees** (one transaction instead of two)

## Requirements

### 1. Manager Address
You **MUST** know the vault manager address:
- **Manager:** `GDQ4HYM5GRYMZX754BWXLCCE5UKNWVVLS2OEP5WNG6NXR6N4NWXA6QYA`

The manager address is required because:
- Only the manager can lock fees (smart contract security)
- Must be passed as both `caller` and `source` in simResult options

### 2. Atomic Execution Order
```javascript
const invocations = [
  new InvocationV0({
    contract: VAULT_CONTRACT_ID,
    method: 'report',      // 1. Update performance data first
    args: []
  }),
  new InvocationV0({
    contract: VAULT_CONTRACT_ID,
    method: 'lock_fees',   // 2. Lock fees based on updated data
    args: [StellarSdk.xdr.ScVal.scvVoid()]  // None = no fee change
  })
];

// Execute with manager authorization
const results = await sdk.simResult(invocations, {
  caller: MANAGER_ACCOUNT,
  source: MANAGER_ACCOUNT
});
```

## Results

### ✅ report() Result:
- Strategy 1: +118,286 tokens profit
- Strategy 2: +129,746 tokens profit
- **Total Gains: +248,032 tokens**

### ✅ lock_fees(None) Result:
- Strategy 1: 23,657 tokens locked
- Strategy 2: 25,949 tokens locked
- **Total Fees Locked: 49,606 tokens**

## Key Functions Called

1. **`fn report(e: Env) -> Result<Vec<Report>, ContractError>`**
   - Returns strategy performance reports
   - No arguments required
   - Read-only function

2. **`fn lock_fees(new_fee_bps: Option<u32>)`**
   - Locks fees based on report data
   - Argument: `Option::None` (no fee parameter change)
   - Requires manager authorization
   - Write operation

## Technology Stack

- **Stellar Router SDK** - Atomic contract call execution
- **@stellar/stellar-sdk** - Stellar/Soroban interaction
- **Node.js ESM** - Modern JavaScript runtime

## Success Criteria

✅ Both functions execute atomically  
✅ Manager authorization provided  
✅ Fees locked after report update  
✅ Consistent state guaranteed  
✅ Single transaction - reduced costs  

## Run Command

```bash
npm start
```

That's it! Simple, focused, and working perfectly.
